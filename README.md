# SwipeToDeleteContact
A tweak that enables swipe to delete in the native contacts app in iOS

So I was working on a tweak to delete a contact via a swipe gesture...

Anyway I got the swiping to be enabled (easy part), but I can't figure out how to delete the contact successfully...

I hope someone can finish this tweak and release it on BigBoss...

EDIT (January 20, 2016): Packetfahrer from Germany has pretty much finished this.
